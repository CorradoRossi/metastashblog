**Here are 10 practical one liners for cultivating financial and spiritual abundance regardless of market conditions adapted from the writing of Dr. Richard Carlson.** [You rolling your eyes?! C'mon anon, it's a down bad season, we all need to hear this stuff from time to time ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‹]

- Whether it's your local 7-11 or the summit of Everest, it's one foot in front of the other, and always starts with the first step.

- It's counterintuitive but the more you give the more you get. Money is circulatory and needs to flow. It's a natural law, so give give give.

- Flush or bust, winning or taking that L, life is cyclical. Attachment to outcome requires energy. Cultivate non-attachment.

- Learn the art of "relaxed passion". Relying on the next big thing leads to boredom. Be absorbed in whatever you're doing. It's time-release passion.

- Maintain wealth consciousness. Get comfortable with feelings of abundance in life. It's a state of mind, even when you're down bad.

- If it sounds too good to be true- it just might not be! Allow for serendipity and be prepared to capitalize on unusual circumstance.

- Work on knowing instead of believing. Woo-woo wishful thinking is not the law of attraction. Embodying and integrating expectation with reality is.

- Remind yourself that life always begins right now. The person you were yesterday is not the person you have to be tomorrow.

- Be willing to change. If you go on doing what you've always done, you'll go on getting what you've always got.

- Express gratitude regularly. It's a virtuous cycle. People love and remember you for it. Even better, it becomes the lens through which you view life.

Did this thread feel eye rollingly corny? I'm experimenting! Since taking a break from the NFT scene during the bear market my tweets seem all to have fallen into a black hole. ðŸ¤£ If you got anything from this thread I'd greatly appreciate a like share or retweet! ðŸ˜‡
